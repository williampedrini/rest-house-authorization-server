```

## Running Tests

1) Import the Postman [local](postman/local.environment.json) environment.
2) Import the Postman [authorization](postman/collection.json) collection.

#### Token Generation

Perform a call to generate the authorization token via Authorization -> Generate Token. The result must follow the pattern below:

```
{
    "access_token": "c53edc32-51a3-4666-b8d6-8fb4d521f586",
    "token_type": "bearer",
    "refresh_token": "bf4b311e-16ca-4eb0-b4fc-f6b6e496739f",
    "expires_in": 10799,
    "scope": "read write"
}
```

#### Token Check

Perform a call to check if a certain token is valid or not using the token generated by the previous test via Authorization -> Check Token. The result must follow the pattern below:

```
{
    "aud": [
        "RestHouseResourceApiId"
    ],
    "user_name": "admin",
    "scope": [
        "read",
        "write"
    ],
    "active": true,
    "exp": 1552260382,
    "authorities": [
        "CUSTOMER_DELETE",
        "OUTCOME_UPDATE",
        "PRODUCT_CREATE",
        "PRODUCT_UPDATE",
        "OUTCOME_READ",
        "OUTCOME_CREATE",
        "OUTCOME_DELETE",
        "CUSTOMER_CREATE",

        "CUSTOMER_READ",
        "PRODUCT_READ",
        "CUSTOMER_UPDATE"
